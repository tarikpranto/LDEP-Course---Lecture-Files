    <h1>Ollie Pope is England's best young player since Joe Root - Michael Vaughan</h1>

    <p><b>Former England captain Michael Vaughan says Ollie Pope is England's best young player since the emergence of current skipper Joe Root.</b></p>
   
    <p>
        Pope, 22, stroked an elegant 91 not out on the first day of the third Test against West Indies to help the hosts to 258-4. <br/>

        "He's a wonderful player," Vaughan told Test Match Special. <br/>
        
        "I don't see a great deal going wrong with his game. It can pretty much cover all conditions." <br/>
        
        Surrey's Pope made his England debut as a 20-year-old against India in 2018, but was left out after playing only two matches. <br/>
